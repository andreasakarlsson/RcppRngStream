* Outline

This is a test-bed for making the RngStream package available for use in other Rcpp packages. We want to manipulate the seeds at the C++ level and use R's non-uniform random numbers. 

The main challenge is being able to use LinkingTo: in the DESCRIPTION of a test package with the static variables.

Can we use Rcpp attributes for registering the functions?

Work in progress...
